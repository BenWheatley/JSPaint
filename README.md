Can ChatGPT make a paint app?

## My personal rules for this game

1. The only thing I can do with the code ChatGPT gives me is copy-paste, there will be zero human corrections.
2. I can re-prompt ChatGPT at any time, including but not limited to describing bugs or just pressing the "regenerate response" button if it misunderstood me.

## Motivation

Yet another argument on Hacker News where someone insists "ChatGPT can't make an entire app" and the first counter-example app was rejected in favour of "I meant like MS Paint", and they were willing to accept even the old-school version. That other person didn't actually specify the rules above, those just seem like reasonable rules to me.

### The point at which motivation was lost

Looks like clipboards need HTTPS, which means I can't be bothered to test if that function works when I'm mostly doing this from BBEdit and a local copy.

## ChatGPT reference link

At time of writing, will need replacement if this project ever gets updated:

## Conclusion

Yes, it can. Just ask for one feature at a time, not the whole thing in one go.

Sure, there's a bug with the offset of the preview of the ellipse if your image is big enough to cause scroll bars to appear — if I hadn't lost motivation half way through, I would ask the magical machine mind to fix it for me.

Hopefully the features which are present and the process by which they appeared is sufficient to demonstrate the point for the rest that I couldn't be bothered to ask for.

## License

You may be in a jurisdiction where none of this is eligible for copyright; if so, you're free to do what you want with the code. If not, it's under an MIT license, which means you're still free to do what you want with the code… but might be required to name me as an author for "moral rights" reasons.
