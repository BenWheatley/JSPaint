Can ChatGPT make a paint app?

## My personal rules for this game

1. The only thing I can do with the code ChatGPT gives me is copy-paste, there will be zero human corrections.
2. I can re-prompt ChatGPT at any time, including but not limited to describing bugs or just pressing the "regenerate response" button if it misunderstood me.

## Motivation

Yet another argument on Hacker News where someone insists "ChatGPT can't make an entire app" and the first counter-example app was rejected in favour of "I meant like MS Paint", and they were willing to accept even the old-school version. That other person didn't actually specify the rules above, those just seem like reasonable rules to me.

## License

You may be in a jurisdiction where none of this is eligible for copyright; if so, you're free to do what you want with the code. If not, it's under an MIT license, which means you're still free to do what you want with the codeâ€¦ but might be required to name me as an author for "moral rights" reasons.
